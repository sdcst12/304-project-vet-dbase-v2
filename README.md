## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment #xx (Total Marks xx)

Objectives:
* Improved Code

An important part of the software development process is to improve your code with subsequent versions that are improved/better. You can think of almost any program that has different versions that have been released over the years.  A more complicated way to improve code is by doing a *patch* or update.

Sidenote: A patch is simply where a program downloads a new set of programming instructions, and then alters its own code using new code that is included in the patch!

Today, we will be working on Veterinarian Database 2.0.  Now that we have a basic understanding of how we can write functions to search, insert and update entries in a databse we can work to improve the organization and presentation of this code.

Version 2.0 should include the following:
* use of a class/object structure
* improved interface
* improved display of data (instead of just raw display of lists, for example)

You will have several classes to work on this assignment.
